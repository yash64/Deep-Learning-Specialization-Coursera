# Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera

This repo contains my work done on `Deep Learning Specialization` offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) in Coursera. Below are the courses offered.

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks
3. Structuring ML Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (partial)
5. Sequence Models (yet to complete)

Each course page has notes, weekly programming assignments, datasets used for assignments and supporting files.

Note: All the work uploaded here is for reference only. This can help if you are stuck anywhere during the programming assignments. Kindly do not copy and paste the code. For any help/clarification on assignments and course there are mentors who can always assist you on [discourse](https://community.deeplearning.ai/c/deep-learning-specialization/6).
